<Developer Instructions>
ALWAYS comment code with its purpose, functionality and implementation. If unsure on how to concisely summarise code with clarity, write longer comments.

Read design.md to understand the project.
After each code implementation, update ./design.md with any important changes you have made. If it is irrelevant to actual technical implementation, do not include it. 
If you have found inconsistencies between actual code and written documentation, always prefer actual code. Alert the user, and update design.md to match.

### Security Instructions
Ensure industry level security
Ensure sanitisation and parametrisation and other industry standard security practises when code involves any SQL operation
